    The strategy revolves around utilizing the Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossover technique on the ETHUSDT trading pair, focusing on a 30-minute time frame.

## Strategy

However, to exercise caution, a Telegram bot was integrated into the system using the "pyTelegramBotAPI" library.

## Pros

    I have acquired new knowledge and gained new insights.

## Cons

    1. The strategy is not equipped to handle sudden market volatility or a market crash effectively.

    2. The strategy does not incorporate a predefined stop-loss mechanism, requiring the implementation of a custom stop-loss approach.

    3. The testing and debugging phase has not been completed due to insufficient funds for conducting thorough testing.

    4. A substantial amount of funding is necessary to ensure the success of the strategy, as well as to accommodate the potential tax implications arising from frequent trading activities.

## Conclusion

    Use it on your own risk ðŸ˜›
